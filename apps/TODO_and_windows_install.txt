I ran into this issue on a windows 11 machine, but the fix that they suggested worked here.

the script ot put in the registry is this if you don't want to use a batch file: 

in Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\*\shell\plottr\command put in this data

C:\Users\Hatlab-MSMT1\.conda\envs\amps\python.exe "C:\Users\Hatlab-MSMT1\Documents\GitHub\plottr\apps\plottr_rightclick.py" "%1"
